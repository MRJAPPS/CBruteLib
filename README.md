# CBruteLib
CBrute is a library for generating passwords and cracking them. It supports multithreading and is useful for people who want to build cracking tools. 
The development of this library has been completely stopped by me.
I have no commitment to this library and have stopped its development completely.
This library met my needs and the reason I published it on GitHub is that I want to have access to it always (in fact, I want to have the algorithms). However, if you want to learn how to work with the library, it is better to add it to your project and start with the SimpleBrute class and see the explanations provided for the functions in the codes.
